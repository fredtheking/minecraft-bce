# Minecraft: Better C++ Edition (hopefully)
So, yea, im gonna try making my own minecraft. In, like, full 3D. Thats gonna be my first experience. God, wish me luck.  
Also, i am making my own fnaf fan-game as of now (using raylib, yay!), so this repo can be quiet empty for some time.  
Gonna work on this project after my game OR when im too bored to code fnaf.  

## Changelog:  
(day.month.year)  
11.09.2025 - Started this repo before going to bed.  
12.09.2025 - A bit bored coding fnaf, so i worked with separating server and client sides. i swear CMakeLists.txt takes more than entire C++ code.
